All in all Case Banana was succesfull, we got what we came for - the pictures.
Granted, this took us way too much time.
	Took us exactly 14 days, that is 2 FUCKING WEEKS! to do something so simply, had we decided to manually do this by hand it would have taken us
	what, 2 - 3 hours. 
		Henceforth, it is nessaccary we set proper objectives and most importantly time deadlines which are respective to the main project at hand.
		2 weeks for the development of a single program that will no longer bear any use for the Mr.Butler is just a waste.

		Thus it is of utmost urgency that before venturing into any side projects, would the time spent developement, testing and using be worth the time
		it take us to actually do said program manually?


	Anyways, thats all. 

	Mission Accomplished.
